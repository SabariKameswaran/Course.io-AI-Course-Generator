# Course.io - AI-Powered Personalized Course Generator

**Course.io** is an innovative platform that creates tailored courses for users by leveraging AI, multimedia content, and user-provided documents (such as PDFs). The platform integrates videos from YouTube, images from Unsplash, and text content to generate personalized learning materials. Additionally, each course comes with an LLM-powered chat assistant, which allows users to ask questions related to the specific topics in the course and receive real-time answers.

## Features

- **Automated Course Generation:** Users can create courses based on predefined topics or upload PDFs, which are then transformed into structured, interactive learning materials.
- **Multimedia Integration:** Courses are enriched with relevant YouTube videos, Unsplash images, and AI-generated text to provide a comprehensive learning experience.
- **PDF-to-Course Feature:** Upload PDFs, and the platform extracts key information to generate courses based on the documentâ€™s content.
- **Real-Time Assistance:** Each course includes a built-in chat assistant powered by a Large Language Model (LLM), which provides instant, context-aware answers to user questions.
- **User-Driven Learning Paths:** Users can create custom courses or follow predefined learning paths.

http://localhost:3000
```

## Project Structure
- /src: Contains all React components and business logic.
- /public: Public assets such as images and the main HTML file.
- /server: Server-side code to manage backend operations.
- /build: Build directory for production.

## Technologies Used
- React.js: Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- Node.js: Backend runtime for server-side logic.
- Tailwind CSS: For rapid UI development with responsive design.
- Express.js: Minimalist framework for backend routing.
- MongoDB: (If applicable) Database for storing application data.
- AI Models: Large Language Model (LLM) for chat functionality, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for PDF processing and course creation
- Multimedia APIs:
    YouTube API: To fetch relevant videos.
    Unsplash API: To fetch related images.

  ## Usage
  - **1.Course Generation:**
      - Navigate to the frontend at http://localhost:3000.
      - Enter topics or upload a PDF to generate a new course.
      - The system will automatically pull in relevant multimedia resources (videos and images) and create a structured course.
   - **2.Real Time Assistance:**
      - During the course, use the integrated chat system to ask questions related to any topic or subtopic.
      - The AI-powered chat will respond with detailed answers in real time, providing additional learning support.
   - **3.PDF Upload:**
      - Upload a PDF document, and the system will extract content to build a course based on the material provided.
   - **4.Personalized Learning:**
      - Customize your learning path based on the topics you wish to explore, and the platform will generate a detailed course for you.

```


### **Flowchart Explanation**:

1. **User Interaction**:
   - Users either upload a PDF or define course topics and subtopics.
   
2. **Backend Processing**:
   - The **Node.js backend** processes the PDF using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to extract relevant content.
   - The **Course Generator** service structures the content, including topics and subtopics, and stores this in the **MongoDB** database.

3. **Multimedia Integration**:
   - The backend integrates with the **YouTube API** and **Unsplash API** to fetch relevant multimedia content (videos and images) to enrich the course.

4. **Frontend**:
   - The **React.js frontend** renders the course for users, displaying both text and multimedia content.

5. **Real-Time Assistance**:
   - Users can ask questions about the course via an integrated **LLM-powered chat assistant**.
   - The backend retrieves the query, communicates with the LLM, and returns the answer to the user in real time.

## **API Endpoints**
